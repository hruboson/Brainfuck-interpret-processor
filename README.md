# Simple processor for Brainfuck lang

Implementation of simple processor in the VHDL language. The processor is taking brainfuck language as its instruction set and executing it.
The processor supports all standard characters and expressions *with the exception of nested cycles*.

The purpose of this repository is purely academical.

## Tests
The code was tested with simple tests for each instruction.
